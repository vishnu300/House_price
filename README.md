House Price Prediction
Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence that.enables self-learning from data and then applies that learning without the need for human intervention.Machine Learning is considered a subset of artificial.intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms that allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences.Arthur Samuel first introduced the term machine learning in 1959

Types of Machine Learning
         Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning: 
• Supervised Learning is the type of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and based on that data, machines predict the output. 
• The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.
Types of Supervised Learning
   1)Classification 
        The key objective of classification based tasks is to predict categorial output labels or responses for the given input data.
                Support Vector Machines
                Logistic Regression
                Random Forest
                Decision Trees
   2)Regression
        The key objective of regression-based tasks is to predict output labels or continuous numeric responses for the given input data.
                Linear Regression
                Non-Linear Regression
                Regression Trees
                Polynomial Regression
                Bayesian Linear Regression
Unsupervised Learning 
• Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using an unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.
• There are no labels or correct outputs. 
• The task is to discover the data structure: for example, grouping similar items to form “clusters” or reducing the data to a small number of important “dimensions”. 
• Data visualisation can also be considered unsupervised learning.
Types of Unsupervised Learning
   1)Clustering
       • Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters.Objects with the most similarities remain in a group, and 
objects with less or no similarities remain in another group.
                K-Means Clustering
                Hierarchal Clustering
                Fuzzy K-Means
                Mixture of Gaussians
                Probabilistic Clustering
                Exclusive Clustering
                Overlapping Clustering

   2)Association
         An association rule is an unsupervised learning method used to find the relationships between variables in the large database.
         • A typical example of the Association rule is Market Basket Analysis.

Semi-Supervised Learning 
• Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labelled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training
